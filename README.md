## Social Wall MEAN Application

This app uses Node, ExpressJS and MongoDB for the Back-end and AngularJS for the Front-end, making it a fully MEAN App (no pun intended).

## First thing's first

# 1. Install NodeJS and MongoDB

# 2. Run npm install inside the API wallapp folder in order for the required modules to be available.

Following requirements, the Front-end App is totally independent from the API, so you'll need to move the Front-end wallapp folder to your WAMP/LAMP/XAMPP/Apache's root/www directory.

That's it! You're good to go!
